- **Historical Trader Data**: Trade-level execution data including execution price, trade size,
  direction, and realized profit or loss.
- **Fear & Greed Index**: Daily market sentiment classification used for contextual analysis.

Large CSV files are tracked using Git LFS due to GitHub file size limitations.

- No predictive modeling, algorithms, or evaluation metrics are included, as they are outside
  the scope of the assignment.
- All code is shared through a publicly accessible Google Colab notebook with view-only access.
